                                        <p class="description">The personal portfolio website project was a self-initiated endeavor aimed at creating a professional online presence to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The goal was to provide a dynamic and visually appealing platform to highlight my expertise in project management, data analysis, and web development.</p>
                                        <p class="description">This project was entirely self-driven, involving extensive learning, experimentation, and iteration to achieve a high-quality result. Feedback from friends and family was solicited after creating a beta version, which ultimately led to a complete redesign and rebuild of the project.</p>

                                        <p class="description">The Warehouse Management System (WMS) Training project aimed to design and implement a robust training program for employees operating WMS software in logistics environments. With the increasing digitization of warehouse operations, understanding how to effectively use WMS platforms has become critical for ensuring efficiency and accuracy in inventory management, order fulfillment, and overall supply chain operations.</p>
                                        <p class="description">The project was initiated as part of my role in data analysis and web project managment at the logistics firm Bleckmann seeking to upskill its workforce and streamline its warehouse processes. The focus was to create an interactive training program tailored to the company's WMS software, targeting both novice and experienced employees. This initiative required balancing technical complexities with accessibility to ensure widespread adoption and engagement.</p>

                                        <p class="description">The planning phase began by identifying the key objectives:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                            <li>Understand the current WMS software's functionalities and limitations.</li>
                                            <li>Analyze the knowledge gaps among employees and their pain points.</li>
                                            <li>Develop a training program that includes theoretical knowledge, hands-on practice, and real-world scenarios.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">To achieve these goals, we divided the project into phases:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Introduction & Context</h5>
                                        <p class="description">Effective project management is essential in any logistics firm to streamline workflows, enhance communication, and meet client expectations. Initially, we faced challenges with fragmented processes reliant on Excel sheets and an overwhelming number of emails, which resulted in inefficiencies and delays. Addressing these bottlenecks required introducing a structured project management tool that could centralize operations, improve visibility, and adapt to the needs of different teams.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Plan</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The project began with identifying the existing challenges across the inbound, customer service, customs, and operations teams. The objectives were clear:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                        <li>Reduce unnecessary email communication.</li>

                                        <li>Improve team collaboration and provide clear client-specific overviews.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">The stakeholders included:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                        <li><b>Inbound and Customer Service Teams:</b> Focused on daily task coordination.</li>
                                        <li><b>Customs and Operations Supervisors:</b> Needed high-level overviews and reporting capabilities.</li>
                                        <li><b>Project Management Team:</b> Responsible for overseeing the overall implementation and ensuring alignment with company goals.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Design</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The initial step involved mapping out workflows and identifying core requirements for the tool. Early designs included:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                        <li>Creating task boards to visualize progress.</li>

                                        <li>Setting up different views for operational tasks, returns, and B2B processes.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">This phase also included presentations to stakeholders, explaining the planned changes and gathering their feedback to ensure alignment with team-specific needs.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Develop</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The development process was iterative, starting with implementing Trello as a prototype to test the Kanban methodology. Initial boards were created with:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                        <li>Standardized workflows for inbound and customer service teams.</li>
                                        <li>Custom statuses for specific clients to improve clarity.</li>
                                        <li>Separate boards for B2B tasks and returns processing.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">Trello’s simplicity allowed the teams to adapt quickly and test the new system without significant disruptions. However, its limitations in client-specific dashboards and advanced calendar views prompted further refinements.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Introduction & Context</h5>
                                        <p class="description">Start2Found was a student-led entrepreneurial initiative aimed at creating a platform that connects startup founders with individuals eager to join and contribute to entrepreneurial ventures. The concept emerged from a recognized gap where founders struggled to find collaborators with the right skill sets and starters lacked opportunities to contribute their expertise to promising ideas.</p>
                                        <p class="description">The project involved collaboration between three students, each bringing unique expertise: app development, SME management, and project management. Stakeholders included expertise centers like "Expedition DO!" and "Gentrepreneur," as well as potential users—entrepreneurs and skilled individuals eager to start their journey.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Plan</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The idea for Start2Found was inspired by a personal conversation with a friend who shared his challenges in launching startup companies. Despite having creative and innovative ideas, his ventures struggled due to a lack of collaborators with complementary skill sets. This inspired the creation of a platform to address this problem.</p>
                                        <p class="description">The core plan revolved around building a swipe-based app that allowed founders to pitch their startup ideas while showcasing their required skill sets. Starters, in turn, could present their expertise, creating an ecosystem of mutual benefit and collaboration.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Design</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The application’s design mimicked the functionality of popular swipe-based platforms. The dual user base consisted of:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                        <li><b>Founders:</b> Individuals with startup ideas. They could create profiles with brief pitches of their ideas, indicating the skill sets they were looking for in collaborators.</li>
                                        <li><b>Starters:</b> Individuals eager to join startups but lacking ideas of their own. Their profiles showcased their skills and the roles they were seeking in startup ventures.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description"> As Product Manager, I worked closely with the app developer to define how the SaaS platform should function. This included mapping user flows, conceptualizing an intuitive user interface, and incorporating features that aligned with user needs, such as a swipe-to-connect mechanism and detailed profile customization options.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Develop</h5>
                                        <p class="description">Development began by leveraging competitions like "Gentrepreneur" and "Expedition DO!" These platforms allowed the team to pitch the app concept, receive valuable feedback from industry experts, and network with potential users. The competitions also provided critical insights into user needs and market positioning.</p>
                                        <p class="description">Marketing efforts included creating initial branding elements, such as logos and app design using Figma. SEO and SEA strategies were researched, along with copyrighting, to lay the foundation for future scalability.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Test</h5>
                                        <p class="description">Feedback sessions at pitching events proved instrumental in refining the concept. The team engaged directly with target users—students and young professionals keen on entrepreneurship—and used their input to iterate on the app design and functionality. The dual feedback loop from expertise centers and users enabled continuous improvements to the app's core proposition.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Review</h5>
                                        <p class="description">During the review phase, it became apparent that the main target audience—students and aspiring entrepreneurs—was concentrated in educational institutions. To maximize reach, the team needed access to entrepreneurship-focused schools, such as Artevelde University College and Ghent University, for in-class presentations and targeted outreach.</p>
                                        <p class="description">However, as team members transitioned into full-time jobs and pursued other commitments, the decision was made to discontinue the project.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Agile Method Follow-Up</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The team implemented Agile methodologies to manage the project.</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                        <li><b>Daily meetings:</b> These facilitated real-time communication and progress tracking.</li>
                                        <li><b>Collaboration tools:</b> Microsoft Teams and Trello were used for task assignments, timeline tracking, and sharing updates.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">This approach enabled the team to adapt quickly to challenges and incorporate stakeholder feedback into the development process.</p>
                                        <p class="description">Start2Found was developed through iterative cycles of pitching, feedback incorporation, and design improvements. While the app did not progress to full deployment, the project validated the need for such a platform and highlighted critical design and marketing elements that could inform future iterations.</p>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Introduction & Context</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The CSR Training for Women in Leadership Positions was part of my bachelor’s thesis project, conducted with a team of five students from Artevelde University of Applied Sciences in the Business Management - International Entrepreneurship program. Our client, Veronica Rubio, is a Co-Founder of Etika and Vectra International. Etika specializes in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) training, focusing on sustainability strategies, social audits, and grievance mechanisms. Their mission is to simplify CSR practices and empower women globally.</p>
                                        <p class="description">The objective was to explore the potential for expanding Etika's CSR training program into four countries—Belgium, Portugal, South Korea, and Spain—while catering to different target groups: students, managers, and companies.</p>
                                        <p class="description">This project also aligned with the emerging trends of sustainability and gender equality, with CSR and women in leadership positions being increasingly important for companies seeking to improve their societal and environmental impact.</p>

                                        <p class="description">To kickstart the project, we outlined the research objectives based on the client’s needs:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                            <li>Gauge interest in CSR training across the four countries.</li>
                                            <li>Identify cultural and economic differences influencing training implementation.</li>
                                            <li>Determine marketing strategies for B2C and B2B audiences.</li>
                                            <li>Analyze gender-specific interest in CSR training, with a focus on women in leadership.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">The project involved desk research into CSR practices, market analysis, and competitors, combined with field research through surveys and interviews. A significant challenge was the COVID-19 pandemic, which restricted in-person interactions, requiring virtual meetings and interviews.</p>

                                        <p class="description">We began by analyzing Veronica Rubio’s companies and projects, focusing on Etika. A thorough examination revealed:</p>

                                            <li>CSR training primarily appeals to women aiming for leadership roles.</li>
                                            <li>Competitors often lacked a personal approach, an area where Etika could differentiate itself.</li>
                                            <li>Language barriers and cultural sensitivities required tailoring training programs for each country.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">Our research questions were categorized to address specific needs:</p>

                                            <li><b>Managers</b> demonstrated enthusiasm for CSR training but preferred courses in their native language for better accessibility.</li>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Introduction & Context</h5>
                                        <p class="description">Xoombike is an innovative bike train concept designed to address multiple modern challenges: providing children with exercise, promoting sustainability, and reducing parental stress in getting kids to school. The bike train consists of a battery-driven go-cart at the front, capable of pulling several attached carts to form a train. This design ensures children can travel safely and sustainably, while also fostering physical activity.</p>
                                        <p class="description">The Xoombike also includes integrated software features, such as a track-and-trace system for safety, calendar functionalities for efficient scheduling, and Uber-style pick-up point customization. These features make Xoombike an appealing solution for schools and parents alike, offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional school transportation.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Plan</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The project began with defining our goals, guided by the subject “Emission Free Vehicles." Initial brainstorming focused on electric vehicles like cars, bikes, and scooters. However, we soon realized that these solutions lacked a clear target audience. By analyzing urban and suburban challenges, we identified parents as a key demographic, particularly those in smaller cities without access to sustainable transportation options.</p>
                                        <p class="description">Parents, especially those juggling work and school drop-offs, faced significant stress in traffic. Addressing this gap became the foundation of our project—to create a solution that eased their burden while aligning with sustainability goals.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Design</h5>
                                        <p class="description">With our target audience defined, we conceptualized a bike train that could transport children to school while reducing parental stress. Key design goals included:</p>
                                        <ul class="desc-list">
                                            <li><b>Affordability:</b> Offering a low-cost alternative to expensive options like electric school buses.</li>
                                            <li><b>Sustainability:</b> Utilizing battery-powered technology to minimize emissions.</li>
                                            <li><b>Physical Activity:</b> Encouraging children to engage in exercise during their commute.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="description">The initial design focused on creating a modular system—a battery-powered go-cart with detachable carts to accommodate varying numbers of children. This modularity ensured scalability and cost-effectiveness for schools and communities.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Development</h5>
                                        <p class="description">The first phase of development involved constructing a prototype Xoombike. This prototype combined durability, ease of use, and safety considerations. The bike train’s design ensured flexibility in the number of children it could transport, while maintaining a compact and user-friendly structure.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Testing</h5>
                                        <p class="description">We introduced our prototype to schools and parents, seeking feedback to refine the design. While the response was overwhelmingly positive, concerns about safety and tracking emerged. Some parents also expressed willingness to volunteer as drivers, which significantly reduced the projected operational costs.</p>
                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Review</h5>
                                        <p class="description">To address safety concerns, we conducted rigorous testing of the Xoombike’s structural integrity. Additional safety measures, such as helmets and fluorescent vests, were incorporated. For added peace of mind, we integrated SaaS and AI solutions:</p>

                                        <div class="underline"></div>

                                        <h5 class="modal-sub-title">Outcomes</h5>
